## Twitter API Keys

To get this to work you'll need Twitter API keys. Go to the [Twitter developer dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) to generate some.

Try these out by setting the values in a file `.env` in the root of where this project is checked out, like so:

```bash
BEARER_TOKEN=AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAC20TQEAAAAAIGwoEgMI0VKMfZH2g56bYC7Eo3g%3D2Ryo0rTT1qXC565i6c0zn8MD7h2X3MmEg5PIXwbLDahgDjq1rs
